            <h1>Introducing Team Builder </h1>
            <p class="bannerDescription">Pickup basketball is a great means for people to exercise, refine their basketball skills, and have fun. Everyone wants to have a good game, and everyone wants to win. But sometimes, teams are skewed and the game is completely uneven.
              Team Builder allows you to create teams that are evenly balanced based on player's abilities.</p>
